#1 Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL of a Cinema Dataset

This work aims to perform a basic exploratory analysis of the movies database. This database contains information about different movies, as well as the persons, with their name and role, involved in each movie. The objective of this work is to explore the different table, as well as to apply some basic filters to extract useful information such as the eldest person, or the number of movies per genre. Finally, the database is modified either removing some useless data, or modifying some specific data.
