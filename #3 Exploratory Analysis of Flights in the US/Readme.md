# estructures_Dataframe

In this repository, we performed an exploratory analysis of a DataSet about Airline Delays. The data comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), and has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses)
. The aim is to understand the reasons behind the delays and cancellation of flights ocurring during 2008 in U.S. 
The folder contains a jupyter notebook with the analysis and an excel file with the final data already cleaned and filtered.
