# 4  Hypothesis Testing for Superconductor Materials

This repository performs a statistical study of a dataset containing different physical properties of superconducting materials. Different features such as the normal distribution between two families of superconductors, or whether or not they show significant difference in their average critical temperature are explored. The repository contains two datasets, one containing the physicial properties of the superconductor and other containing its chemical structure, as well as the Jupyter notebook with the code.
