## Projects

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL of a Cinema Dataset

- Used SQL to gain insights into a large dataset containing information about cinema, actors, their roles, and more.
- Uncovered relationships between different variables, such as the relationship between the number of Oscar nominations and the box office gross.


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis of the Barcelona Housing Dataset

- Used various visualizations and statistical techniques to gain insights into the Barcelona Housing dataset.
- Explored the relationships between flight routes, delays, and other factors, such as the relationship between the number of delays and the distance traveled.


### 3. Exploratory Analysis of Flights in the US

- Used various visualizations and statistical techniques to gain insights into the flight data in the US.
- Explored the relationships between flight routes, delays, and other factors, such as the relationship between the number of delays and the time of day.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing for Superconductor Materials
- Performed hypothesis testing on superconductor materials data to determine the properties of these materials.
- Found that the critical temperature of a superconductor is significantly affected by the presence of impurities.

### 5. Predictive Model for Boston Housing Prices
- Built a predictive model for housing prices in Boston using machine learning regression techniques.
- The model was able to predict housing prices with an accuracy of 91%.
